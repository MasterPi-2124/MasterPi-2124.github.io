      <description>Hi, this is my quick guideline on how to improve linux development experience.
Operating system When you search for &amp;ldquo;Linux OS&amp;rdquo;, Google would give you thousands of &amp;ldquo;operation systems&amp;rdquo; like Ubuntu, Arch, Mint, &amp;hellip; So which one is best for you?
First, &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo; as you say is not &amp;ldquo;operating system&amp;rdquo;. It is the kernel, the bridge between software and hardware, and reponsible for almost everything in the computer. When you boot your computer, it is the first part of the OS loaded into the RAM for your system to start working.</description>

      <title>Story Behind My TEDx Event</title>

      <description>When I was in high school, I was inspired by TED videos and its idea to share people&amp;rsquo;s thinking with the world. I started watching a lot of its videos, and became a translator, to help bring TED&amp;rsquo;s videos to more people in the country. The deeper I dived in, the more I wanted to become a TEDx organizer, because it&amp;rsquo;s still not very popular in the community. Finally, when I came to university, I had a chance, but some people still block my way to reach the end.</description>

      <title>What This Blog Is All About</title>

      <description>Some first words The Journey, my blog, is a story book of mine which is about all aspects in my life, and knowledge I learned in life of living (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about that, my life is quite boring).
 Why I name my site &amp;ldquo;The Journey&amp;rdquo;?
 Good question. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, too. I feel it is catchy.
But blogging is not the main target of this site. I have a bad memory, so writing things down is the best way to store it, and maybe it could be helpful for some people.</description>

      <description>If you used Mac products before, I bet the only thing you will never forget is its multi-touch trackpad. Its convenience can improve the work performance a lot, and it even made me feel confused when using other products&amp;rsquo;s trackpad. Luckily, when you say &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo;, you are talking about the &amp;ldquo;Open Sources&amp;rdquo;, and there are some drivers that support it, like mtrack.
In this blog, we will dive into how we can make our trackpad as close to Mac experience as we can get with mtrack.</description>
