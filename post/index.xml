      <description>Hi again. This is Dung Dao Minh, vice president of SoICT Innovation Club, and in this third post of series &amp;ldquo;Github 101&amp;rdquo;, I will talk about some kind of scenarios that can happen when you work on multiple branches in your work repositories, or work in collaboration with a team on a project.
First words In many cases, you (and your collaborators) create multiple branches for different purpose: creating features, bug fixing, code versioning,&amp;hellip; Most of the issues happen when you try to combine the code between those branches: you may realize that you still commit to the main branch while fixing bugs/adding features, another developer may add a little documentation on your code (which is great), or your evil coworker might mess up with your code and make it full of bugs.</description>

      <description>Here are every error I got when trying to run a full node. For difference between nodes and validators, see other posts in my blog.
Common step in every node Below are the common setup for all node:
 Clone from a remote repository Checkout a version. This step is really important and is the most difficult step because you don&amp;rsquo;t know which version can run or not. Most problems occur can be fixed by change the version, which is only by try-and-fail.</description>

      <description>Hello, in this episode we will discuss branches in git, and how to push, pull or merge. We also talk about the remote repository and local repository, and how to connect them. There are a lot of things to discuss but I will focus on the background, and the remain can be learned by exercising.
Remote repository When you clone a repository from the Internet, you may notice that it will copy all the content of the project, even every versions, branches, &amp;hellip; In other word, you are simply link the remote project to your local repository.</description>

      <title>How I Setup My Development Environment</title>

      <description>Hi, this is my quick guideline on how to improve linux development experience.
Operating system When you search for &amp;ldquo;Linux OS&amp;rdquo;, Google would give you thousands of &amp;ldquo;operation systems&amp;rdquo; like Ubuntu, Arch, Mint, &amp;hellip; So which one is best for you?
First, &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo; as you say is not &amp;ldquo;operating system&amp;rdquo;. It is the kernel, the bridge between software and hardware, and reponsible for almost everything in the computer. When you boot your computer, it is the first part of the OS loaded into the RAM for your system to start working.</description>

      <description>When I was in high school, I was inspired by TED videos and its idea to share people&amp;rsquo;s thinking with the world. I started watching a lot of its videos, and became a translator, to help bring TED&amp;rsquo;s videos to more people in the country. The deeper I dived in, the more I wanted to become a TEDx organizer, because it&amp;rsquo;s still not very popular in the community. Finally, when I came to university, I had a chance, but some people still block my way to reach the end.</description>

      <title>What This Blog Is All About</title>

      <description>Some first words The Journey, my blog, is a story book of mine which is about all aspects in my life, and knowledge I learned in life of living (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about that, my life is quite boring).
 Why I name my site &amp;ldquo;The Journey&amp;rdquo;?
 Good question. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, too. I feel it is catchy.
But blogging is not the main target of this site. I have a bad memory, so writing things down is the best way to store it, and maybe it could be helpful for some people.</description>

      <description>If you used Mac products before, I bet the only thing you will never forget is its multi-touch trackpad. Its convenience can improve the work performance a lot, and it even made me feel confused when using other products&amp;rsquo;s trackpad. Luckily, when you say &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo;, you are talking about the &amp;ldquo;Open Sources&amp;rdquo;, and there are some drivers that support it, like mtrack.
In this blog, we will dive into how we can make our trackpad as close to Mac experience as we can get with mtrack.</description>
