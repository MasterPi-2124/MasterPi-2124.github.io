      <description>When I was in high school, I was inspired by TED videos and its idea to share people&amp;rsquo;s thinking with the world. I started watching a lot of its videos, and became a translator, to help bring TED&amp;rsquo;s videos to more people in the country. The deeper I dived in, the more I wanted to become a TEDx organizer, because it&amp;rsquo;s still not very popular in the community. Finally, when I came to university, I had a chance, but some people still block my way to reach the end.</description>
