[{"content":"If you used Mac products before, I bet the only thing you will never forget is its multi-touch trackpad. Its convenience can improve the work performance a lot, and it even made me feel confused when using other products\u0026rsquo;s trackpad. Luckily, when you say \u0026ldquo;Linux\u0026rdquo;, you are talking about the \u0026ldquo;Open Sources\u0026rdquo;, and there are some drivers that support it, like mtrack.\nIn this blog, we will dive into how we can make our trackpad as close to Mac experience as we can get with mtrack.\nWhy mtrack? In Linux, there are 3 options for mouse driver: mtrack, libinput and synaptics, but the default driver for almost every Linux distro libinput doesn\u0026rsquo;t have many options for us to tweak, while mtrack has many flexible configurations, and supports a lot of gestures. The only downside of mtrack is it\u0026rsquo;s quite outdate (since 2015), so we will have to clone the community\u0026rsquo;s driver from GitHub.\nAnd be noted that mtrack supports only Xorg environment.1\nInstall the driver First, we need to install the prerequisites for the driver:\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade sudo apt install build-essential git pkg-config libmtdev-dev mtdev-tools xserver-xorg-dev xutils-dev Install mtrack driver:\ncd /tmp git clone git clone https://github.com/p2rkw/xf86-input-mtrack.git \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd xf86-input-mtrack ./configure --with-xorg-module-dir=/usr/lib/xorg/modules sudo make sudo make install If you get stuck on the install progress, leave me a comment down there.\nConfigure the new driver If the install progress is successfull, the driver should be in the system, but we still need to edit the configuration file so that the system could recognize and use it.\nConfiguration file The configuration file gets placed in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mtrack.conf and it contains options for the trackpad too. We will edit this file and restart the system2 to make changes.\n# You can use other text editor, but it can only be saved with root permission sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mtrack.conf The configuration file should be in this form (mine):\n# https://github.com/p2rkw/xf86-input-mtrack Section\t\u0026quot;InputClass\u0026quot; MatchIsTouchpad\t\u0026quot;on\u0026quot; Identifier\t\u0026quot;Touchpads\u0026quot; MatchDevicePath \u0026quot;/dev/input/event*\u0026quot; Driver\t\u0026quot;mtrack\u0026quot; ## Basic # Disable Trackpad Option\t\u0026quot;TrackpadDisable\u0026quot;\t\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; # Whether or not to enable physical button on trackpad Option \u0026quot;ButtonEnable\u0026quot; \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; # If the button is integrated into the trackpad like Macbook Pros, this option has to be \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; Option \u0026quot;ButtonIntegrated\u0026quot; \u0026quot;false\u0026quot; ## Responsiveness # The faster you move, the more distance pointer will travel, using \u0026quot;polynomial\u0026quot; profile Option \u0026quot;AccelerationProfile\u0026quot;\t\u0026quot;2\u0026quot; # Sensitivity controls how fast your cursor will move. 1 is the default Option \u0026quot;Sensitivity\u0026quot; \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; # Define the pressure at which a finger is detected as a touch Option \u0026quot;FingerHigh\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5\u0026quot; # Defines the pressure at which a finger is detected as a release Option \u0026quot;FingerLow\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5\u0026quot; # Whether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be thumbs Option \u0026quot;IgnoreThumb\u0026quot; \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; # The minimum size of what's considered a thumb. # It is expected that a thumb will be larger than other fingers Option \u0026quot;ThumbSize\u0026quot; \u0026quot;25\u0026quot; # The width/length ratio of what's considered a thumb. # It is expected that a thumb is longer than it is wide Option \u0026quot;ThumbRatio\u0026quot; \u0026quot;70\u0026quot; # Whether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a thumb is touching Option \u0026quot;DisableOnThumb\u0026quot; \u0026quot;false\u0026quot; # Whether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be palms Option \u0026quot;IgnorePalm\u0026quot; \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; # Whether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a palm is touching Option \u0026quot;DisableOnPalm\u0026quot; \u0026quot;false\u0026quot; # The minimum size of what's considered a palm. # Palms are expected to be very large on the trackpad Option \u0026quot;PalmSize\u0026quot; \u0026quot;40\u0026quot; ## Zones # Whether or not to enable button zones. # If button zones are enabled then the trackpad will be # split into one, two, or three vertical zones Option\t\u0026quot;ButtonZonesEnable\u0026quot;\t\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; # The button to emulate when the zone is pressed. # This is the leftmost part of the pad.

My configuration above is as close as my Mac experience as I can get, and you can adjust to suit your need too.\nMore tweaks, head to the driver\u0026rsquo;s README.\nDisable when typing As the title, the most annoying thing when using mtrack is that it is not disable when typing, if you set option TapButton1 to 1. So we will need dispad, a daemon from the origion authors of mtrack:\nsudo apt install libconfuse-dev libxi-dev cd /tmp git clone https://github.com/BlueDragonX/dispad.git \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd dispad ./configure sudo make sudo make install After built successfully, start the daemon by typing dispad.\nAdd more gestures Currently, mtrack supports up to 15 mouse simulations, however, Ubuntu and some other distros only uses mouse buttons up to 9. To make use of other gestures, we will need some tools.\nsudo apt install xbindkeys xdotool xbindkeys is a daemon listening to your inputs from any input devices including keyboard, mouse and touchpad. You’ll define a rule at which, if an input or combination of inputs matches, some command can be executed. That’s where xdotool come in. xdotool is the command line tool which is able to simulate other key inputs. So by combining xbindkeys and xdotool, we’ll be able to map high mouse buttons (\u0026gt; 9) to certain shortcuts that suit our needs.\nTo define the rule, we need to edit the configuration file which is at ~/.xbindkeysrc, and the detail of the tool is here if you need to see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xbindkeys.\nConclusion That’s my setup for multi-touch touchpad, and it is the as closest as Mac experience I can get. However, there still are some issues with mtrack driver after a lot of use, which is minor and do not affect the experience much:\n Scroll coast are sometimes sticky and make scroll move quickly in subsequence scroll gestures. Dispad sometimes doesn’t detect typing and lets the caret jump.  Thanks for reading, and let me know in the comment if it helps you!\n  It doesn\u0026rsquo;t work on Wayland environment, but I\u0026rsquo;m fine about that because Xorg is more popular and has better performance and resource usage.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The only way to make it work is by restarting X Server, but you can\u0026rsquo;t just run startx or log out and log in again, so my official reccommendation is restarting the system.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":"2021-09-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://masterpi-2124.github.io/p/how-to-make-your-trackpad-like-macbook/cover_hu6ba39792d6537feec4d1f896302b7aea_37093_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://masterpi-2124.github.io/p/how-to-make-your-trackpad-like-macbook/","title":"How to Make Your Trackpad Like Macbook"},{"content":"Hi, this is my way to make a Github blog for my self, which will contain blogs, some projects, and some tips from my experience. I am a webasite newbie, so it took me almost 2 days to setup from start to finish, and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy. Here is how I made it.\nInitial setup Create repositories First, let take a look at what a Github Page is, and how to create one. You should be able to create a repository for your Github Page named username.github.io, where username is your Github username.\nThe repository above will store the content of your website, but we will create another repository where the website development/authoring will take place, for example, Personal-Blog.\nInstall Hugo There are multiple ways to install Hugo:\n Install from binary releases on Github. I reccommend installing the extended version, because some themes will run only on this version. On a Mac with Homebrew installed, run brew install hugo On Windows with Chocolatey: choco install hugo[-extended] -confirm  Create a site Initialize a new site Let\u0026rsquo;s clone 2 repositories we created above to start:\ngit clone https://github.com/username/Personal-Blog.git Replace username with your username and Personal-Blog with your repository\u0026rsquo;s name.\nGoto the repository\u0026rsquo;s root directory, and start with hugo new site .with . will tell Hugo to create the site in the current directory.\nYou will see the folders and files like in this structure:\nsite_root |-- archetypes |-- assets |-- content |-- data |-- layouts |-- static |-- themes |-- config.toml The detail explaination for each folder is published on Hugo documentation, and it is necessary to understand it before continue.\nInstall theme Next, we wll pick a theme at Hugo theme website and install in themes folder. I will choose Hugo Stack Theme for the demonstration.\nCopy the theme\u0026rsquo;s github path, and install:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack themes/hugo-theme-stack Go to the installed theme directory, you will see the exampleSite folder. Copy its content and paste into content folder. It stores all page and post we create for the website, so we will use it to test the new site.\nReplace config.toml by config.yaml copied above, and modify this file as in this intruction.\nPublish to Github Page After you add a post or a site, it\u0026rsquo;s time to push into the repository and publish. But first, we have to link the Github page repository to the current development repository:\ngit submodule add -b master https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git public It will clone the repository into public folder, as in Hugo documentation about directory structure.
