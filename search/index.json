[{"content":"Hi again. This is Dung Dao Minh, vice president of SoICT Innovation Club, and in this third post of series \u0026ldquo;Github 101\u0026rdquo;, I will talk about some kind of scenarios that can happen when you work on multiple branches in your work repositories, or work in collaboration with a team on a project.\nFirst words In many cases, you (and your collaborators) create multiple branches for different purpose: creating features, bug fixing, code versioning,\u0026hellip; Most of the issues happen when you try to combine the code between those branches: you may realize that you still commit to the main branch while fixing bugs/adding features, another developer may add a little documentation on your code (which is great), or your evil coworker might mess up with your code and make it full of bugs. In short, there may be some modification on the branch you are trying to merge into, that you need to resolve to (happily) combine the two different commits.\nI will create (with additional references from other sources) some different scenarios here that represent the problem you might face when working on different branches, and make it easy to introduce some new definition, as well as some good practices when working with Git and Github\nScenario #1: Working on new feature (no file conflict yet) Suppose that you are working on a project about real estate recommendation system, and you want to try using location information for your system. In the middle of your work, your boss want you to focus 100% of your time on improving system based on demographic information.\nStep 1: assume that you are on the develop branch. You should create a new branch location for developing the new feature:\n# Create and switch to new branch git checkout -b location # Commit as you go  git commit -m \u0026#34;add recommendation based on city\u0026#39; Step 2: however, you boss want you to focus on demographic features. You have not completed the location feature yet\n# Switch back to the develop branch git checkout develop # Create and switch to `demographic` branch git checkout -b demographic # Working on that branch and commit changes git commit -m \u0026#34;finalized demographic-based recommendation\u0026#34; Step 3: after you finish your work on demographic feature, you can merge it to the develop branch and push this to the remote origin/develop branch (assuming that both develop and origin/develop have no additional commit in the mean time)\n# Switch back to the develop branch git checkout develop # Merge the `demographic` branch into the `develop` branch git merge --no-ff demographic # Push to the remote repository git push origin develop Quick note on merge: fast-forward vs. no fast-forward You might see the --no-ff (no fast-forward) in the step 3 above. The new demographic code seems to only add new code, without any modification.\nA picture is worth a thousand words:\n Fast forward \n--no-ff will create a new commit (with new id, but the file content is the same), while by default, git merge will fast-forward - moving your branch pointer (in this case, at develop) to point at the incoming commit (from demographic).\nNote: when you merge with --no-ff, as a new commit is created, you might be asked to create message for that commit.\nIn many cases, you want to prevent fast-forward from happening, because you want to maintain a specific branch \u0026ldquo;shape\u0026rdquo;, and someone (your manager) can read the history of changes that you made from creating the demographic branch (instead of losing information when fast-forward)\nYou can change you command or do some setups to merge with or without feed-forward:\n# Execute for once: add the `--ff-only`, or `--no-ff` flag # Apply for both pull and merge (pull = fetch + merge) git pull --ff-only git pull --no-ff # Using git config to do it by default  # (git pull or git merge won\u0026#39;t need specific flag) git config --add merge.ff false git config --add merge.ff only Scenario #2: Same file names, different file contents on different branches (conflict) You might wonder what\u0026rsquo;s the purpose of the location branch created above. Now I will use it to demonstrate merge conflict.\nIn a bad mood, you forgot that you create that location branch for experimenting with location data, and you do some commit directly on the develop branch to work with that data. Let review some of the recent commits you made (notice the HEAD-\u0026gt;location (current branch) at commit f3b1b57 and the develop branch at commit 9a5187c)\ngit log --graph --decorate --oneline --all * 9a5187c (develop) add recommendation based on city in develop * 1fe34c7 Merge branch 'demographic' into develop |\\ | * 0883fd7 (demographic) finalized demographic-based recommendation |/ | * f3b1b57 (HEAD -\u0026gt; location) add recommendation based on city |/ * b3a463a (origin/develop) Create develop branch For simple demonstration purpose, here are the 2 versions of location.txt on that 2 branches:\n# On `develop` branch location file in develop # On `location` branch location file Some ways you might consider to resolve the conflict When you realize the mistake, there are some cases here:\nCase 1: You recognize that there are part of the features you develop from both branches would be useful, and you want to combine them together.\nRun the command git merge develop will create the following message:\nAuto-merging location.txt CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in location.txt Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result. This is inevitable, since the 2 files have different contents inside. Inside the location.txt file, you can see that the content has been modified. The upper part is the line of the current commit pointed by HEAD and the lower part is the\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; HEAD location file ======= location file in develop \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; develop Check git status for additional understanding:\nOn branch location You have unmerged paths. ... Unmerged paths: (use \u0026quot;git add \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;...\u0026quot; to mark resolution) both added: location.txt To resolve the problem, simply modify the location.txt file as you wish (obviously, you don\u0026rsquo;t want those \u0026ldquo;\u0026laquo;\u0026lt;\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;===\u0026rdquo; characters anyway) and add it to the staging area, then create a new commit. Here I will modify the text into \u0026ldquo;location file after resolve conflict\u0026rdquo;:\ngit add location.txt git status # On branch location # All conflicts fixed but you are still merging. # ... git commit -m \u0026#34;resolve conflict in location feature\u0026#34; git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all # Now we see that the `location` branch has new commit * 1f79c56 (location) resolve conflict in location feature |\\  | * 9a5187c (HEAD -\u0026gt; develop) add recommendation based on city in develop | * 1fe34c7 Merge branch \u0026#39;demographic\u0026#39; into develop Case 2: You have done a far better work in the develop branch, and you don\u0026rsquo;t need the same code on location branch anymore. Or the other way around, you soon realize the mistake, and the location branch has more valuable code\nThe obvious solution is to use the code in develop instead of that code on location, or the other way around. You can use the approach in Case 1, observing that in some IDE, they support you with choosing the respective version you want. An example in VSCode (you can accept either change or both changes):\n Conflict VSCode \nA quicker way is to use additional flags, in favor of one of the branch (ours strategy refer to preference of the current branch, and theirs is the preference of the incoming branch):\ngit merge --strategy=ours develop git merge -X theirs develop Note: -s or --strategy completely ignore the other side, while -X or --strategy-option resolve any conflicts using the chosen side.\nAdditional note: merge vs rebase, and options for git pull Perhaps some animation is great here (acknowledgement to Nicola Paolucci\u0026rsquo;s post with the animations). Click on animated images to see how it works:  Merge   Rebase \nYou should use git rebase when your changes do not \u0026ldquo;deserve\u0026rdquo; a separate branch for its own. All the commands with merge above can also be done with rebase; note that it has a different behaviour as in the animations\nWhen working with remote directories, if you want to rebase instead of merge after fetching changes, you can add --rebase flag to the pull command:\n git pull = git fetch + git merge against tracking upstream branch git pull --rebase = git fetch + git rebase against tracking upstream branch  Final words The conflict in reality can be more complex, but in this episode, I have list the common cases you might face when you need to merge 2 branches together.\nThere are some images in the post, some are mine, some are from the Internet, and it’s free to use as in the LICENSE below.

We also talk about the remote repository and local repository, and how to connect them. There are a lot of things to discuss but I will focus on the background, and the remain can be learned by exercising.\nRemote repository When you clone a repository from the Internet, you may notice that it will copy all the content of the project, even every versions, branches, \u0026hellip; In other word, you are simply link the remote project to your local repository. You can check the remote repository with:\ngit remote -v The result may be similar to this:\norigin https://github.com/MasterPi-2124/MasterPi-2124.github.io.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/MasterPi-2124/MasterPi-2124.github.io.git (push) origin is the shortname of the remote repository that your project was originally cloned from. It is the replacement for the repository\u0026rsquo;s URL, and can be helpful when you push or pull from this remote one. You can change this too, but it\u0026rsquo;s better to leave it unchanged (because people leave that too).\nSo if you have a local repository and want to connect to a remote repository, simply do this:\ngit remote add origin URL_TO_YOUR_PROJECT Be careful before connecting. Run git commit if there are unsaved changes.\nBranch Let\u0026rsquo;s say, you have a project about an application. There are so many versions of it, and you are working on a specific version, v1.0.6. The stable version of the application is v1.0.0, so you should not fuck up with this because any errors in your code may ruin the project. In this case, you will have to create a new branch, named v1.0.6 or something, so your change is on this branch, not the stable branch v1.0.0. Here is an illustration of branches in git:  Branches  From the image, you can see that branch is a version of the project, which is isolated from the others and does not affect other versions of the project. You can work in branches, commit changes, push, and merge branches, which will be discussed in this episode.\nYou can check all branches in your local repository:\ngit branch # Similar to git branch -l Want to see all remote branches too?\ngit branch -r You can use -a flag to see all local and remote branches.\nYou can create a new branch too, but not check out to it yet:\ngit branch BRANCH_NAME If you want to create a branch and check out:\ngit checkout -b BRANCH_NAME Remember that the branches you created above are not shown on the remote repository, they are just at the local and can be checked with git branch -a. If you want to create a branch in a remote repository, jump to \u0026ldquo;Push\u0026rdquo; section.\nWant to delete the branch you are working on?\ngit branch -d BRANCH_NAME This will safely delete the specific branch, it stops if this branch has unmerged changes. You can overwrite this by using -D flag, it will delete everything in this branch.\nYou can jump to different branches too:\ngit checkout BRANCH_NAME Make sure BRANCH_NAME exists.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go to a specific example. You are here, main branch\u0026quot;  You are at “main”  Then, create and check out to a local branch named \u0026ldquo;ahihi\u0026rdquo;:\ngit checkout -b ahihi  You are now at “ahihi”  Remember, HEAD is now at ahihi, not main anymore.  HEAD is now at “ahihi”  ahihi is now ahead of main with unmerged changes, so you just can\u0026rsquo;t delete ahihi safely. You have to use -D to completely remove this branch:\ngit branch -D ahihi Push When you are in a local branch and want to push to the remote repository, you have to commit your change and make sure that your local repository is synced with the remote.\ngit push origin BRANCH_NAME This will push to the specific branch in the remote repository. If the branch is not on the remote, this branch will be created. So check carefully before pushing. Here is an illustration of push:  Before push  After push  You can also use git push to delete a remote branch too:\ngit push origin :BRANCH_NAME The colon : before branch will tell git push to delete the remote branch. It\u0026rsquo;s suggested to delete both local and remote branches.\nFetch, Pull and Merge git fetch is a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository. git fetch has similar behavior to git pull, however, git fetch can be considered a safer, nondestructive version. Think git fetch like synchronizing the *remote repository, which will download all content from the repository without updating the local repository to match that content, while git pull creates a merge commit and HEAD is updated to point at the new commit.\nIn conclusion,\n git pull = git fetch + git merge\n  Before fetch  After fetch  After merge  In many scenarios, git pull may lead to conflict when trying to merge branches, that require you to manually check for differences. More particular situations will be shown in the next episodes.\nFinal words So above is \u0026ldquo;Getting used to Github\u0026rdquo;, eps. 2.

This would include some basic commands, tips and what to do in some specific situations. You also know how to deal with problems occur during the building setup, and a basic knowledge of GitHub Flow, what CI/CD is, \u0026hellip; This is the first post in series \u0026ldquo;Github 101\u0026rdquo;, and you can find other posts at \u0026ldquo;See also\u0026rdquo; section.\nThis series also contain many real-life situations, and the procedures for each situation. Of course it will never be enough, and it comes from my experience too, so my series could be not enough for you. I reccommend you to leave your comment or help me to complete this guideline for as many people as possible.\nFirst words You may don\u0026rsquo;t need to read this part, but I still write for who want to see what is git and what it can do. So let\u0026rsquo;s go through some boring theoretical knowledge of it.\nGit is a tool to managing your code project. That\u0026rsquo;s the simplest meaning of git. When you collaborate with your friends in projects, you can\u0026rsquo;t know what others do, and even you also don\u0026rsquo;t know if your code is working or not. So your team will need a Version Control System to control your code, versions of the project, and you can go back if there are any problems. Git helps you get updated with your code, change version of project, see the difference between branchs or commits, merge or create a new branch to work separately,\u0026hellip; A lot of work could never be done without git, so this means if you want to start you coding life, you must know how to use git.\nGithub, Gitlab, BitBucket are code collaboration and version control tools offering repository management. In this guide, we will focus on Github, because it is quite popular (not really true), and quite suitable for starters. But I always reccommend you to try the other options, especially Gitlab, and you can decide yourself later.\nInstall git First, let\u0026rsquo;s start by getting git on our machine.\n If you are Mac user and have Homebrew installed  brew install git  If you use Linux, many distros have git installed for you. If not, try installing via package management. For example:  sudo apt install git  If you use Windows, follow instruction on https://git-scm.com/download/win.  There are also GUI version of git, but I reccommend CLI, for two reasons:\n It looks cooler than GUI Almost every git guideline is by commands, so CLI help you understand git better.  Getting started Once you got git installed, let\u0026rsquo;s dive in.\nConfigure Check git version:\ngit --version Configure git:\ngit config --global user.name \u0026#34;Your name here\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;Your mail here\u0026#34; These are basic configurations of git to make your life easier, and of course there are more. You can check other configurations with:\ngit config -h or check what you edited:\ngit config -l Getting and creating projects What\u0026rsquo;s git used for? Projects. I hope you guess right. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how we make a project or clone some.\nYou can make a project, and initialize with git:\ngit init It will generate a new folder, named \u0026ldquo;.git\u0026rdquo; inside your project. You can take a look to see more, but it\u0026rsquo;s not quite neccessary.\nWant to work on a project from Github? Here\u0026rsquo;s how:\ngit clone URL_TO_YOUR_PROJECT It will create a folder and download all the content of the project into that folder.\nCommit So you got you project. Let\u0026rsquo;s make some changes in it. After you complete, you may need to snapshot it to a \u0026ldquo;commit\u0026rdquo;, like a version of the project, or a checkpoint (if you are a gamer), which will track any changes in there. From that, you can easily trace or go back if you code is not working.\nIn git, you may see the term \u0026ldquo;stage\u0026rdquo;. Think it like actors about to perform on stage. They first have to stay in a room behind the stage to prepare, and \u0026ldquo;stage\u0026rdquo; in git is like that too. When you working on changes, you first have to place your file into a place called \u0026ldquo;stage\u0026rdquo; before taking a snapshot.  A visual explaination of stage \nTo commit changes, run this:\n# Add all changed file to \u0026#34;stage\u0026#34; git add . # Create a commit with a message git commit -m \u0026#34;Your message\u0026#34; You may see the file named .gitingnore in your project. This file will contain folders and files you don\u0026rsquo;t want to track (add to stage), so when you run git add ., it will add all changed file which are not in the file, to stage. Here is an example of this file:\n# Binaries for programs and plugins *.exe *.exe~ *.dll *.so *.dylib # Test binary, built with `go test -c` *.test # Output of the go coverage tool, specifically when used with LiteIDE *.out # Dependency directories (remove the comment below to include it) # vendor/ public/ So when you run git add ., it will ignore files with extension .exe, .exe~, \u0026hellip;, or public folder.\nA more tip about how to write a \u0026ldquo;readable\u0026rdquo; message: Always show what you have changed, or problem you fix, and it could help you very much when you want to go back. An example:\n Add README file, fix issue #1, fix rendering error\n not\n Hey other coders, guess what I changed?\n You can also see history of commits in the current branch by:\ngit log Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, we will discuss about branch later.  Example output of git log \nYou may see HEAD. It is like a pointer. For example, you are currently at commit \u0026ldquo;Commit 1\u0026rdquo;, so HEAD will point to this commit.  HEAD - like a pointer \nYou can see details of a commit, by running this:\ngit show COMMIT_ADDRESS While COMMIT_ADDRESS is the string of characters right after \u0026ldquo;commit\u0026rdquo;, or you just use HEAD for current commit.\nIf you want to undo commit, or return to a previous commit, run this command:\ngit reset --soft COMMIT_ADDRESS or\ngit reset --soft HEAD~n # n is number of last commits you want to undo Final words So above is \u0026ldquo;Getting used to Github\u0026rdquo;, eps. 1.

It is the kernel, the bridge between software and hardware, and reponsible for almost everything in the computer. When you boot your computer, it is the first part of the OS loaded into the RAM for your system to start working.\nThere are many Linux distributions built upon the kernel and use a separate package managing system to suit many specific purposes. So before choosing a distro, you should know your reasons of using linux.\n If you are new to linux and just need a boost, start with Ubuntu, Nitrux or Zorin OS. They are both friendly to new users, with Windows-like interface, so you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t get confused when migrating. If you want to have a perfect environment for developing, Debian is one of your consideration list. There are also many other distros, like Manjaro, openSUSE, Solus, Fedora \u0026hellip; You can install dev-branch of many distros for its specific development too. If you want a light weight distro and do not need many unnecessary apps, Linux Lite or ZorinOS Lite is the best choice. If you are advanced user, the only distro I can reccommend is Arch.1  Look and feel Desktop enviroment is also an important part in the OS. I will list some of them here, by my actual experience:\n KDE Plasma 5: My most favorite DE, which I am also contributing to. Xfce: it\u0026rsquo;s really simple and light-weight Cinnamon: It\u0026rsquo;s good looking at first glance, and easy to tweak too LXDE: another light-weight DE for old machines GNOME Shell: The most popular one, and look like MacOS too Deepin: the best-looking DE by some f*** chinese guys who don\u0026rsquo;t care about privacy  Let\u0026rsquo;s note that you can choose your favorite DE in some distros, but some others don\u0026rsquo;t give you that option.\nHere is my KDE Plama DE:  My Desktop Environment   Konsole \nEssential packages I use so many packages to support my projects, and it depends on your purposes too. But these following are the most importatnt tools that everyone needs.\nRemember, you can install them via package managers like apt, pacman, pkg, \u0026hellip; but many of them are not upgrade frequently and it may causes problems with your projects. If you need cutting-edge packages for your project, I suggest installing from source.\n git, and(or) gh docker gcc, g++, make, cmake, autoconf, automake, build-essential, gdb Popular languages: NodeJS, python3, ruby, perl, go, java, \u0026hellip; Visual Studio Code, or your favorite text editor. Some system tools: gparted, timeshift, \u0026hellip;  What to know? Using linux means you should know a lot about it, but some errors may appear suddenly and you can\u0026rsquo;t just search Google for help. So basic understanding and skills are required to join the party.\n CLI - Commandline Interface. You have to control everything almost by command in the terminal, so get used to that. Users and groups. Permission in Linux is really important, so knowing who you are is the fisrt lesson to survive through system errors. Compile packages. There are so many ways to build a package, and this is the most boring part when you have to deal with any errors that can happen anytime. You should be familiar with building from source, installing binary archives, or using package managers. The completion of your experience relies on the number of errors you meet. Search Google. This is your life rescuer, so learn how to use it effeciently. How linux works. You should have basic knowledge about how a linux system works, the meaning of folders in root directory, how kernel interacts with hardwares and sofwares,\u0026hellip; This is useful when you face a system problem (and it\u0026rsquo;s frequent). Reseting the system should be the last way of rescuing your system.  Conclusion Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s hard, and you may spend your whole life to buid a linux system. But it\u0026rsquo;s funny though.\nSome final words, the above is based on my actual experience of 5-year using Linux, so it can contain something hard to understand. And you can personalize your liux distro to suit your need.\nThank you for reading!\n  btw I use Arch.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":"2021-09-16T21:54:03+07:00","image":"https://masterpi-2124.github.io/p/how-i-setup-my-development-environment/cover_hu2de967c73d0d4ca2655d32ad36eb3545_1361613_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://masterpi-2124.github.io/p/how-i-setup-my-development-environment/","title":"How I Setup My Development Environment"},{"content":"When I was in high school, I was inspired by TED videos and its idea to share people\u0026rsquo;s thinking with the world. I started watching a lot of its videos, and became a translator, to help bring TED\u0026rsquo;s videos to more people in the country. The deeper I dived in, the more I wanted to become a TEDx organizer, because it\u0026rsquo;s still not very popular in the community. Finally, when I came to university, I had a chance, but some people still block my way to reach the end.\nThe story begins when I told my friends about my idea of a TEDx event inside the university. They really liked it, and even helped me start this project. We still are students, so a approval from teacher is required to organize an legal event in a university. At first, I thought that\u0026rsquo;s weird, but actually, it\u0026rsquo;s good because it can help prevent many meaningless events from going rampant. We brought this idea to some teachers, and they loved it too. They assured that, if we have an idea that help local students, just do it. Luckily, it\u0026rsquo;s also the purpose of this event, so to this point, we were 100% proud of the bright future of this event.\nBut things are always not as you expected.\nIn the last minutes, when we prepared our event proposal to the school administrators, they somehow denied and told me that:\n A student like you never can organize such an event like this, and the reponsibility of a student is studying and working in projects, companies, \u0026hellip; Events like it are really hard to be held, even teachers can\u0026rsquo;t either. You should study instead, not organize events like this to get nothing.\n They even gave a reason that:\n \u0026ldquo;An event held by a foreign organization could inteprete the university\u0026rsquo;s reputation\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;We concern about the political issues that a foreign organization can make during the event, that could lead to some very serious problems with the authorities\u0026rdquo;.\n  Q: What could you do when a speaker accidentially (or intentionally) disclose some sensitive information?\n  A: Just don\u0026rsquo;t make it happen, TED has regulations for that too.\n  Q: Why do you trust organizations like TED?\n  A: \u0026hellip;\n Why did they say that? I asked them, and the answer is simple: if you can prove it, prove it before showing any more detail.\nAnd they even didn\u0026rsquo;t give me any chances to prove.\nThis is a common story among some universities. Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about it.\nFisrt, if the event is good for the university, you can organize it. If not? DIY.\n What is a good event? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t harm the university in all ways.\n  Does it need to be benefical to students? No, just don\u0026rsquo;t harm the university\u0026rsquo;s reputation.\n  What does that mean by \u0026ldquo;benefical to students\u0026rdquo;? They get points for joining that.\n Second, an event in the university must reflect the university brand in it, for example, you should create an event which topic is about something in that university. This, of course, violate the regulation of TED about the aim of the event:\n TEDx events are independent:\n Because TEDx events are stand-alone events, they may not be combined with or integrated into any conference, ceremony, event, or curriculum. TEDx events cannot be co-branded: you may not connect the TEDx logo/identity/name to the name of another organization, non-profit, corporation or other entity. You may not present your TEDx event as being organized by such entities or positioned as one of their offerings.   Third, if you are a regular student, never dream of organizing an event easily. This\u0026rsquo;s all about relationship, where a regular student like me, who do not attend any groups in the university, do not know many powerfull people in school, do not have the right to prove my idea is better than others. That sounds ridiculous, because I pay for what I receive, and I now received what?\nAfter that denial, we tried so hard to prove to the administrators, but it all leaded to a new dark side of this university: The univeristy is a very complicated system, which makes a very simple problem become serious. To make things work, you have to contact, persue a lot of people, and that is a vicious circle I have to step in.\nMy TEDx event type is Universities, which means it should be held in university scale, not a small group scale, so in other word, a TEDx event in this university is impossible because, the teacher just don\u0026rsquo;t like and don\u0026rsquo;t trust a normal student.\nOne more thing about this university, it is famous for its very hard subjects, mainly about theories and really little on-job practice. This makes students have to focus on studying and don\u0026rsquo;t have many time to do other work. When I recruited members for the project, a lot of people wanted to join in, but they can\u0026rsquo;t be sure about the amout of time spending on the project. All of the answers I can hear is, \u0026ldquo;sorry, I have to study for the final exam\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;damn, last semester is too bad and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make it happen again\u0026rdquo;. Not all students are like that, but it is enough to make this school stand out from the rest, a \u0026ldquo;technical university\u0026rdquo;.\nMany events in this university are held by students and some organizations, but all of them have to go through administrator\u0026rsquo;s review process. We\u0026rsquo;re good about that, but they eventually lost theirs values when students only participate if they can get points for their score board. The more points you can get (maximum 100), the more active you are. (!?)\nA motivation of this is scholar, and the fear of geting Fs. This makes the whole things you do in school is for your points in paper.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I cancel this project and organize another TEDx event that can not be affected by any organizations. So it is good that we are independent from anyone, just make a plan and glue thing together. But it is also a downside, when we have to manage to find sponsors, speakers, while many members in my team don\u0026rsquo;t have any experiences in these fields. And of course, the COVID pandemic also prevent us from making any progress. In other words, it is frozen. But my story hasn\u0026rsquo;t come to the end yet, and we are trying many ways to make it possible.\nSo if you are an energetic person, or if you have a lot of ideas, please do not choose universities that\u0026rsquo;s heavy on theories, study and close-mind. These schools don\u0026rsquo;t deserve to be your choice.\nIf you want to support my event, there are many ways to do it:\n If you have an idea you want to share, apply for the speakers of the event. If you want to join and help us make the event available to public, let us know via fanpage or e-mail. If you want to sponsor this project, we are happy to receive that. If you are enterprises and want to collaborate with us during the event, we will discuss on what both sides can do. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do? Share it so that we can reach out more people in local community!

I don\u0026rsquo;t know, too. I feel it is catchy.\nBut blogging is not the main target of this site. I have a bad memory, so writing things down is the best way to store it, and maybe it could be helpful for some people. I will mainly talk about everything in my development path, which can be cover from casual stories when coding, some tips and hacks, or some TL;DR topics. I will dive deeper about topic in below section.\nThis site includes 3 parts: Guideline, Blogs and Projects\n Guideline: My how-to on almost everything in both development and life. How to live? How to implement Metamask or other wallet into your blockchain? I don\u0026rsquo;t know the answer of both question, but I will answer in the near future. Blog: As its name, it is about my personal stories. What personal stories? Personal stories that I want to share. Project: That\u0026rsquo;s is the main one. I will document my project, so that you will have the most overview of the whole thing, and you can dive into the detail too, if you can.  I really want to document everything, so that if someone want to learn, or me when forget, can go to the site, read the blog, do some pratice with it, and we could save a lot of time. My document skill is not so good, so if there are some typo, or some misleading information, leave the comment in the comment section, or contact me so I can fix as quickly as possible.\nTopics I plan to cover I am a developer, so obviously my main posts will be around the development progress. These below are the topics that interest me, and it is flexible.\nOpen source I\u0026rsquo;m currently using many open-source applications, and participate in open-source projects, from 2017. These applicaions (or projects) are maintained by a group of people, and they are free. But there are also some downsides of it, especially bugs. When I started diving in open source world, the first thing I faced is bugs. A lot of bugs, and many of them were not fixed, so at that time, the only thing I did is rebuilding the whole thing. Luckily, after 4 years, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t happens so frequently, and I learnt a lot from that.\nThere are a lot of thing to talk about open source, but I will focus mainly on my experiences, some fixes or workarounds, or some advices how to contribute to open source projects. I will also explain and document my projects, because you have the rights to learn, read and contribute. You are welcome to contribute my blog too, by supporting or editting, and I really appreciate that.\nThe most important thing in Open source is License. I will create a post about difference among license types, and some advices to choose licenses in your projects. You can see at the end of every post in my site, there is a license for that.\nLinux I started using Linux from 2016, and since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced a lot in inux world. In this topic, I will talk about how I tweak my Linux distro, use Linux for daily development work, and my projects on KDE.\nI also reccommend if you are developer, you must know how to use Linux (or some thing similar to that). It is open source, and I bet you will like it right after you boot into the desktop enviroment.\nBlockchain Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m learning Blockchain, it is the main reason why I created this blog. I do not know much about it, because I\u0026rsquo;ve just touched it for 3 months, and I really need somewhere to store my knowledge.\nIn this topic, I won\u0026rsquo;t talk about how to become rich in Blockchain, it\u0026rsquo;s not how blockchain works. I will talk about the engine behind it, some technical terms, how things work,\u0026hellip; alongside with my blockchain projects.\nOther topics When I wrote this post, I only planned talking about these above, but as I say, it is not flexible, and I will write down everything as long as I know about it. So stay focus, and ask me if you want to know something.\nFor example, I can talk about books, materials, some helpful links and other things that help people. If you have something want to share with me, please let me know in the comment, or contact.\nConclusion Here is my post about the aim of this blog. I do not expect much about that, but I hope it could help someone in the future.\nIf you want to be informed, subscribe to this page in the subscribe section, so you will receive latest posts when it is coming to my blog.

Its convenience can improve the work performance a lot, and it even made me feel confused when using other products\u0026rsquo;s trackpad. Luckily, when you say \u0026ldquo;Linux\u0026rdquo;, you are talking about the \u0026ldquo;Open Sources\u0026rdquo;, and there are some drivers that support it, like mtrack.\nIn this blog, we will dive into how we can make our trackpad as close to Mac experience as we can get with mtrack.\nWhy mtrack? In Linux, there are 3 options for mouse driver: mtrack, libinput and synaptics, but the default driver for almost every Linux distro libinput doesn\u0026rsquo;t have many options for us to tweak, while mtrack has many flexible configurations, and supports a lot of gestures. The only downside of mtrack is it\u0026rsquo;s quite outdate (since 2015), so we will have to clone the community\u0026rsquo;s driver from GitHub.\nAnd be noted that mtrack supports only Xorg environment.1\nInstall the driver First, we need to install the prerequisites for the driver:\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade sudo apt install build-essential git pkg-config libmtdev-dev mtdev-tools xserver-xorg-dev xutils-dev Install mtrack driver:\ncd /tmp git clone git clone https://github.com/p2rkw/xf86-input-mtrack.git \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd xf86-input-mtrack ./configure --with-xorg-module-dir=/usr/lib/xorg/modules sudo make sudo make install If you get stuck on the install progress, leave me a comment down there.\nConfigure the new driver If the install progress is successfull, the driver should be in the system, but we still need to edit the configuration file so that the system could recognize and use it.\nConfiguration file The configuration file gets placed in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mtrack.conf and it contains options for the trackpad too. We will edit this file and restart the system2 to make changes.\n# You can use other text editor, but it can only be saved with root permission sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mtrack.conf The configuration file should be in this form (mine):\n# https://github.com/p2rkw/xf86-input-mtrack Section\t\u0026#34;InputClass\u0026#34; MatchIsTouchpad\t\u0026#34;on\u0026#34; Identifier\t\u0026#34;Touchpads\u0026#34; MatchDevicePath \u0026#34;/dev/input/event*\u0026#34; Driver\t\u0026#34;mtrack\u0026#34; # Basic # Disable Trackpad Option\t\u0026#34;TrackpadDisable\u0026#34;\t\u0026#34;false\u0026#34; # Whether or not to enable physical button on trackpad Option \u0026#34;ButtonEnable\u0026#34; \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; # If the button is integrated into the trackpad like Macbook Pros, this option has to be \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; Option \u0026#34;ButtonIntegrated\u0026#34; \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; # Responsiveness # The faster you move, the more distance pointer will travel, using \u0026#34;polynomial\u0026#34; profile Option \u0026#34;AccelerationProfile\u0026#34;\t\u0026#34;2\u0026#34; # Sensitivity controls how fast your cursor will move. 1 is the default Option \u0026#34;Sensitivity\u0026#34; \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; # Define the pressure at which a finger is detected as a touch Option \u0026#34;FingerHigh\u0026#34; \u0026#34;5\u0026#34; # Defines the pressure at which a finger is detected as a release Option \u0026#34;FingerLow\u0026#34; \u0026#34;5\u0026#34; # Whether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be thumbs Option \u0026#34;IgnoreThumb\u0026#34; \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; # The minimum size of what\u0026#39;s considered a thumb. # It is expected that a thumb will be larger than other fingers Option \u0026#34;ThumbSize\u0026#34; \u0026#34;25\u0026#34; # The width/length ratio of what\u0026#39;s considered a thumb. # It is expected that a thumb is longer than it is wide Option \u0026#34;ThumbRatio\u0026#34; \u0026#34;70\u0026#34; # Whether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a thumb is touching Option \u0026#34;DisableOnThumb\u0026#34; \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; # Whether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be palms Option \u0026#34;IgnorePalm\u0026#34; \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; # Whether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a palm is touching Option \u0026#34;DisableOnPalm\u0026#34; \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; # The minimum size of what\u0026#39;s considered a palm. # Palms are expected to be very large on the trackpad Option \u0026#34;PalmSize\u0026#34; \u0026#34;40\u0026#34; # Zones # Whether or not to enable button zones. # If button zones are enabled then the trackpad will be # split into one, two, or three vertical zones Option\t\u0026#34;ButtonZonesEnable\u0026#34;\t\u0026#34;false\u0026#34; # The button to emulate when the zone is pressed. # This is the leftmost part of the pad.

My configuration above is as close as my Mac experience as I can get, and you can adjust to suit your need too.\nMore tweaks, head to the driver\u0026rsquo;s README.\nDisable when typing As the title, the most annoying thing when using mtrack is that it is not disable when typing, if you set option TapButton1 to 1. So we will need dispad, a daemon from the origion authors of mtrack:\nsudo apt install libconfuse-dev libxi-dev cd /tmp git clone https://github.com/BlueDragonX/dispad.git \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd dispad ./configure sudo make sudo make install After built successfully, start the daemon by typing dispad.\nAdd more gestures Currently, mtrack supports up to 15 mouse simulations, however, Ubuntu and some other distros only uses mouse buttons up to 9. To make use of other gestures, we will need some tools.\nsudo apt install xbindkeys xdotool xbindkeys is a daemon listening to your inputs from any input devices including keyboard, mouse and touchpad. You’ll define a rule at which, if an input or combination of inputs matches, some command can be executed. That’s where xdotool come in. xdotool is the command line tool which is able to simulate other key inputs. So by combining xbindkeys and xdotool, we’ll be able to map high mouse buttons (\u0026gt; 9) to certain shortcuts that suit our needs.\nTo define the rule, we need to edit the configuration file which is at ~/.xbindkeysrc, and the detail of the tool is here if you need to see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xbindkeys.\nConclusion That’s my setup for multi-touch touchpad, and it is the as closest as Mac experience I can get. However, there still are some issues with mtrack driver after a lot of use, which is minor and do not affect the experience much:\n Scroll coast are sometimes sticky and make scroll move quickly in subsequence scroll gestures. Dispad sometimes doesn’t detect typing and lets the caret jump.

I am a webasite newbie, so it took me almost 2 days to setup from start to finish, and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy. Here is how I made it.\nInitial setup Create repositories First, let take a look at what a Github Page is, and how to create one. You should be able to create a repository for your Github Page named username.github.io, where username is your Github username.\nThe repository above will store the content of your website, but we will create another repository where the website development/authoring will take place, for example, Personal-Blog.\nInstall Hugo There are multiple ways to install Hugo:\n Install from binary releases on Github. I reccommend installing the extended version, because some themes will run only on this version. On a Mac with Homebrew installed, run brew install hugo On Windows with Chocolatey: choco install hugo[-extended] -confirm  Create a site Initialize a new site Let\u0026rsquo;s clone 2 repositories we created above to start:\ngit clone https://github.com/username/Personal-Blog.git Replace username with your username and Personal-Blog with your repository\u0026rsquo;s name.\nGoto the repository\u0026rsquo;s root directory, and start with hugo new site .with . will tell Hugo to create the site in the current directory.\nYou will see the folders and files like in this structure:\nsite_root |-- archetypes |-- assets |-- content |-- data |-- layouts |-- static |-- themes |-- config.toml The detail explaination for each folder is published on Hugo documentation, and it is necessary to understand it before continue.\nInstall theme Next, we wll pick a theme at Hugo theme website and install in themes folder. I will choose Hugo Stack Theme for the demonstration.\nCopy the theme\u0026rsquo;s github path, and install:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack themes/hugo-theme-stack Go to the installed theme directory, you will see the exampleSite folder. Copy its content and paste into content folder. It stores all page and post we create for the website, so we will use it to test the new site.\nReplace config.toml by config.yaml copied above, and modify this file as in this intruction.\nPublish to Github Page After you add a post or a site, it\u0026rsquo;s time to push into the repository and publish. But first, we have to link the Github page repository to the current development repository:\ngit submodule add -b master https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git public It will clone the repository into public folder, as in Hugo documentation about directory structure. Check again with git remote -v:\norigin\thttps://github.com/username/username.github.io.git (fetch) origin\thttps://github.com/username/username.github.io.git (push) Then publish the site by running ./deploy.sh:\n#!/bin/sh  # If a command fails then the deploy stops set -e # Build the project printf \u0026#34;\\033[0;32mDeploying updates to GitHub...\\033[0m\\n\u0026#34; hugo -D --buildFuture echo \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Commit and push to GitHub Page repository printf \u0026#34;\\033[0;32mGo to /public...\\033[0m\\n\u0026#34; cd public git add . echo \u0026#34;\u0026#34; read -p \u0026#34;Enter your commit message: \u0026#34; msg echo \u0026#34;\\033[0;32mCommitting changes...\\033[0m\\n\u0026#34; git commit -m \u0026#34;$msg\u0026#34; git push echo \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Commit and push to site repository printf \u0026#34;\\033[0;32mGo to root...\\033[0m\\n\u0026#34; cd .. git add . echo \u0026#34;\u0026#34; read -p \u0026#34;Enter your commit message: \u0026#34; msg echo \u0026#34;\\033[0;32mCommitting changes...\\033[0m\\n\u0026#34; git commit -m \u0026#34;$msg\u0026#34; git push printf \u0026#34;\\033[0;32mChanges are commited and push successfully!
