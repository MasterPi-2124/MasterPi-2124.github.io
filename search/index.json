[{"content":"When I was in high school, I was inspired by TED videos and its idea to share people\u0026rsquo;s thinking with the world. I started watching a lot of its videos, and became a translator, to help bring TED\u0026rsquo;s videos to more people in the country. The deeper I dived in, the more I wanted to become a TEDx organizer, because it\u0026rsquo;s still not very popular in the community. Finally, when I came to university, I had a chance, but some people still block my way to reach the end.\nThe story begins when I told my friends about my idea of a TEDx event inside the university. They really liked it, and even helped me start this project. We still are students, so a approval from teacher is required to organize an legal event in a university. At first, I thought that\u0026rsquo;s weird, but actually, it\u0026rsquo;s good because it can help prevent many meaningless events from going rampant. We brought this idea to some teachers, and they loved it too. They assured that, if we have an idea that help local students, just do it. Luckily, it\u0026rsquo;s also the purpose of this event, so to this point, we were 100% proud of the bright future of this event.\nBut things are always not as you expected.\nIn the last minutes, when we prepared our event proposal to the school administrators, they somehow denied and told me that:\n A student like you never can organize such an event like this, and the reponsibility of a student is studying and working in projects, companies, \u0026hellip; Events like it are really hard to be held, even teachers can\u0026rsquo;t either. You should study instead, not organize events like this to get nothing.\n They even gave a reason that:\n \u0026ldquo;An event held by a foreign organization could inteprete the university\u0026rsquo;s reputation\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;We concern about the political issues that a foreign organization can make during the event, that could lead to some very serious problems with the authorities\u0026rdquo;.\n  Q: What could you do when a speaker accidentially (or intentionally) disclose some sensitive information?\n  A: Just don\u0026rsquo;t make it happen, TED has regulations for that too.\n  Q: Why do you trust organizations like TED?\n  A: \u0026hellip;\n Why did they say that? I asked them, and the answer is simple: if you can prove it, prove it before showing any more detail.\nAnd they even didn\u0026rsquo;t give me any chances to prove.\nThis is a common story among some universities. Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about it.\nFisrt, if the event is good for the university, you can organize it. If not? DIY.\n What is a good event? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t harm the university in all ways.\n  Does it need to be benefical to students? No, just don\u0026rsquo;t harm the university\u0026rsquo;s reputation.\n  What does that mean by \u0026ldquo;benefical to students\u0026rdquo;? They get points for joining that.\n Second, an event in the university must reflect the university brand in it, for example, you should create an event which topic is about something in that university. This, of course, violate the regulation of TED about the aim of the event:\n TEDx events are independent:\n Because TEDx events are stand-alone events, they may not be combined with or integrated into any conference, ceremony, event, or curriculum. TEDx events cannot be co-branded: you may not connect the TEDx logo/identity/name to the name of another organization, non-profit, corporation or other entity. You may not present your TEDx event as being organized by such entities or positioned as one of their offerings.   Third, if you are a regular student, never dream of organizing an event easily. This\u0026rsquo;s all about relationship, where a regular student like me, who do not attend any groups in the university, do not know many powerfull people in school, do not have the right to prove my idea is better than others. That sounds ridiculous, because I pay for what I receive, and I now received what?\nAfter that denial, we tried so hard to prove to the administrators, but it all leaded to a new dark side of this university: The univeristy is a very complicated system, which makes a very simple problem become serious. To make things work, you have to contact, persue a lot of people, and that is a vicious circle I have to step in.\nMy TEDx event type is Universities, which means it should be held in university scale, not a small group scale, so in other word, a TEDx event in this university is impossible because, the teacher just don\u0026rsquo;t like and don\u0026rsquo;t trust a normal student.\nOne more thing about this university, it is famous for its very hard subjects, mainly about theories and really little on-job practice. This makes students have to focus on studying and don\u0026rsquo;t have many time to do other work. When I recruited members for the project, a lot of people wanted to join in, but they can\u0026rsquo;t be sure about the amout of time spending on the project. All of the answers I can hear is, \u0026ldquo;sorry, I have to study for the final exam\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;damn, last semester is too bad and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make it happen again\u0026rdquo;. Not all students are like that, but it is enough to make this school stand out from the rest, a \u0026ldquo;technical university\u0026rdquo;.\nMany events in this university are held by students and some organizations, but all of them have to go through administrator\u0026rsquo;s review process. We\u0026rsquo;re good about that, but they eventually lost theirs values when students only participate if they can get points for their score board. The more points you can get (maximum 100), the more active you are. (!?)\nA motivation of this is scholar, and the fear of geting Fs. This makes the whole things you do in school is for your points in paper.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I cancel this project and organize another TEDx event that can not be affected by any organizations. So it is good that we are independent from anyone, just make a plan and glue thing together. But it is also a downside, when we have to manage to find sponsors, speakers, while many members in my team don\u0026rsquo;t have any experiences in these fields. And of course, the COVID pandemic also prevent us from making any progress. In other words, it is frozen. But my story hasn\u0026rsquo;t come to the end yet, and we are trying many ways to make it possible.\nSo if you are an energetic person, or if you have a lot of ideas, please do not choose universities that\u0026rsquo;s heavy on theories, study and close-mind. These schools don\u0026rsquo;t deserve to be your choice.\nIf you want to support my event, there are many ways to do it:\n If you have an idea you want to share, apply for the speakers of the event. If you want to join and help us make the event available to public, let us know via fanpage or e-mail. If you want to sponsor this project, we are happy to receive that. If you are enterprises and want to collaborate with us during the event, we will discuss on what both sides can do. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do? Share it so that we can reach out more people in local community!

I don\u0026rsquo;t know, too. I feel it is catchy.\nBut blogging is not the main target of this site. I have a bad memory, so writing things down is the best way to store it, and maybe it could be helpful for some people. I will mainly talk about everything in my development path, which can be cover from casual stories when coding, some tips and hacks, or some TL;DR topics. I will dive deeper about topic in below section.\nThis site includes 3 parts: Guideline, Blogs and Projects\n Guideline: My how-to on almost everything in both development and life. How to live? How to implement Metamask or other wallet into your blockchain? I don\u0026rsquo;t know the answer of both question, but I will answer in the near future. Blog: As its name, it is about my personal stories. What personal stories? Personal stories that I want to share. Project: That\u0026rsquo;s is the main one. I will document my project, so that you will have the most overview of the whole thing, and you can dive into the detail too, if you can.  I really want to document everything, so that if someone want to learn, or me when forget, can go to the site, read the blog, do some pratice with it, and we could save a lot of time. My document skill is not so good, so if there are some typo, or some misleading information, leave the comment in the comment section, or contact me so I can fix as quickly as possible.\nTopics I plan to cover I am a developer, so obviously my main posts will be around the development progress. These below are the topics that interest me, and it is flexible.\nOpen source I\u0026rsquo;m currently using many open-source applications, and participate in open-source projects, from 2017. These applicaions (or projects) are maintained by a group of people, and they are free. But there are also some downsides of it, especially bugs. When I started diving in open source world, the first thing I faced is bugs. A lot of bugs, and many of them were not fixed, so at that time, the only thing I did is rebuilding the whole thing. Luckily, after 4 years, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t happens so frequently, and I learnt a lot from that.\nThere are a lot of thing to talk about open source, but I will focus mainly on my experiences, some fixes or workarounds, or some advices how to contribute to open source projects. I will also explain and document my projects, because you have the rights to learn, read and contribute. You are welcome to contribute my blog too, by supporting or editting, and I really appreciate that.\nThe most important thing in Open source is License. I will create a post about difference among license types, and some advices to choose licenses in your projects. You can see at the end of every post in my site, there is a license for that.\nLinux I started using Linux from 2016, and since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced a lot in inux world. In this topic, I will talk about how I tweak my Linux distro, use Linux for daily development work, and my projects on KDE.\nI also reccommend if you are developer, you must know how to use Linux (or some thing similar to that). It is open source, and I bet you will like it right after you boot into the desktop enviroment.\nBlockchain Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m learning Blockchain, it is the main reason why I created this blog. I do not know much about it, because I\u0026rsquo;ve just touched it for 3 months, and I really need somewhere to store my knowledge.\nIn this topic, I won\u0026rsquo;t talk about how to become rich in Blockchain, it\u0026rsquo;s not how blockchain works. I will talk about the engine behind it, some technical terms, how things work,\u0026hellip; alongside with my blockchain projects.\nOther topics When I wrote this post, I only planned talking about these above, but as I say, it is not flexible, and I will write down everything as long as I know about it. So stay focus, and ask me if you want to know something.\nFor example, I can talk about books, materials, some helpful links and other things that help people. If you have something want to share with me, please let me know in the comment, or contact.\nConclusion Here is my post about the aim of this blog. I do not expect much about that, but I hope it could help someone in the future.\nIf you want to be informed, subscribe to this page in the subscribe section, so you will receive latest posts when it is coming to my blog. If you want to support (that\u0026rsquo;s so nice), please drop me some coins or help me make this blog better.

Its convenience can improve the work performance a lot, and it even made me feel confused when using other products\u0026rsquo;s trackpad. Luckily, when you say \u0026ldquo;Linux\u0026rdquo;, you are talking about the \u0026ldquo;Open Sources\u0026rdquo;, and there are some drivers that support it, like mtrack.\nIn this blog, we will dive into how we can make our trackpad as close to Mac experience as we can get with mtrack.\nWhy mtrack? In Linux, there are 3 options for mouse driver: mtrack, libinput and synaptics, but the default driver for almost every Linux distro libinput doesn\u0026rsquo;t have many options for us to tweak, while mtrack has many flexible configurations, and supports a lot of gestures. The only downside of mtrack is it\u0026rsquo;s quite outdate (since 2015), so we will have to clone the community\u0026rsquo;s driver from GitHub.\nAnd be noted that mtrack supports only Xorg environment.1\nInstall the driver First, we need to install the prerequisites for the driver:\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade sudo apt install build-essential git pkg-config libmtdev-dev mtdev-tools xserver-xorg-dev xutils-dev Install mtrack driver:\ncd /tmp git clone git clone https://github.com/p2rkw/xf86-input-mtrack.git \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd xf86-input-mtrack ./configure --with-xorg-module-dir=/usr/lib/xorg/modules sudo make sudo make install If you get stuck on the install progress, leave me a comment down there.\nConfigure the new driver If the install progress is successfull, the driver should be in the system, but we still need to edit the configuration file so that the system could recognize and use it.\nConfiguration file The configuration file gets placed in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mtrack.conf and it contains options for the trackpad too. We will edit this file and restart the system2 to make changes.\n# You can use other text editor, but it can only be saved with root permission sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mtrack.conf The configuration file should be in this form (mine):\n# https://github.com/p2rkw/xf86-input-mtrack Section\t\u0026quot;InputClass\u0026quot; MatchIsTouchpad\t\u0026quot;on\u0026quot; Identifier\t\u0026quot;Touchpads\u0026quot; MatchDevicePath \u0026quot;/dev/input/event*\u0026quot; Driver\t\u0026quot;mtrack\u0026quot; # Basic # Disable Trackpad Option\t\u0026quot;TrackpadDisable\u0026quot;\t\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; # Whether or not to enable physical button on trackpad Option \u0026quot;ButtonEnable\u0026quot; \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; # If the button is integrated into the trackpad like Macbook Pros, this option has to be \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; Option \u0026quot;ButtonIntegrated\u0026quot; \u0026quot;false\u0026quot; # Responsiveness # The faster you move, the more distance pointer will travel, using \u0026quot;polynomial\u0026quot; profile Option \u0026quot;AccelerationProfile\u0026quot;\t\u0026quot;2\u0026quot; # Sensitivity controls how fast your cursor will move. 1 is the default Option \u0026quot;Sensitivity\u0026quot; \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; # Define the pressure at which a finger is detected as a touch Option \u0026quot;FingerHigh\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5\u0026quot; # Defines the pressure at which a finger is detected as a release Option \u0026quot;FingerLow\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5\u0026quot; # Whether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be thumbs Option \u0026quot;IgnoreThumb\u0026quot; \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; # The minimum size of what's considered a thumb. # It is expected that a thumb will be larger than other fingers Option \u0026quot;ThumbSize\u0026quot; \u0026quot;25\u0026quot; # The width/length ratio of what's considered a thumb. # It is expected that a thumb is longer than it is wide Option \u0026quot;ThumbRatio\u0026quot; \u0026quot;70\u0026quot; # Whether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a thumb is touching Option \u0026quot;DisableOnThumb\u0026quot; \u0026quot;false\u0026quot; # Whether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be palms Option \u0026quot;IgnorePalm\u0026quot; \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; # Whether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a palm is touching Option \u0026quot;DisableOnPalm\u0026quot; \u0026quot;false\u0026quot; # The minimum size of what's considered a palm. # Palms are expected to be very large on the trackpad Option \u0026quot;PalmSize\u0026quot; \u0026quot;40\u0026quot; # Zones # Whether or not to enable button zones. # If button zones are enabled then the trackpad will be # split into one, two, or three vertical zones Option\t\u0026quot;ButtonZonesEnable\u0026quot;\t\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; # The button to emulate when the zone is pressed. # This is the leftmost part of the pad.

My configuration above is as close as my Mac experience as I can get, and you can adjust to suit your need too.\nMore tweaks, head to the driver\u0026rsquo;s README.\nDisable when typing As the title, the most annoying thing when using mtrack is that it is not disable when typing, if you set option TapButton1 to 1. So we will need dispad, a daemon from the origion authors of mtrack:\nsudo apt install libconfuse-dev libxi-dev cd /tmp git clone https://github.com/BlueDragonX/dispad.git \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd dispad ./configure sudo make sudo make install After built successfully, start the daemon by typing dispad.\nAdd more gestures Currently, mtrack supports up to 15 mouse simulations, however, Ubuntu and some other distros only uses mouse buttons up to 9. To make use of other gestures, we will need some tools.\nsudo apt install xbindkeys xdotool xbindkeys is a daemon listening to your inputs from any input devices including keyboard, mouse and touchpad. You’ll define a rule at which, if an input or combination of inputs matches, some command can be executed. That’s where xdotool come in. xdotool is the command line tool which is able to simulate other key inputs. So by combining xbindkeys and xdotool, we’ll be able to map high mouse buttons (\u0026gt; 9) to certain shortcuts that suit our needs.\nTo define the rule, we need to edit the configuration file which is at ~/.xbindkeysrc, and the detail of the tool is here if you need to see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xbindkeys.\nConclusion That’s my setup for multi-touch touchpad, and it is the as closest as Mac experience I can get. However, there still are some issues with mtrack driver after a lot of use, which is minor and do not affect the experience much:\n Scroll coast are sometimes sticky and make scroll move quickly in subsequence scroll gestures. Dispad sometimes doesn’t detect typing and lets the caret jump.

I am a webasite newbie, so it took me almost 2 days to setup from start to finish, and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy. Here is how I made it.\nInitial setup Create repositories First, let take a look at what a Github Page is, and how to create one. You should be able to create a repository for your Github Page named username.github.io, where username is your Github username.\nThe repository above will store the content of your website, but we will create another repository where the website development/authoring will take place, for example, Personal-Blog.\nInstall Hugo There are multiple ways to install Hugo:\n Install from binary releases on Github. I reccommend installing the extended version, because some themes will run only on this version. On a Mac with Homebrew installed, run brew install hugo On Windows with Chocolatey: choco install hugo[-extended] -confirm  Create a site Initialize a new site Let\u0026rsquo;s clone 2 repositories we created above to start:\ngit clone https://github.com/username/Personal-Blog.git Replace username with your username and Personal-Blog with your repository\u0026rsquo;s name.\nGoto the repository\u0026rsquo;s root directory, and start with hugo new site .with . will tell Hugo to create the site in the current directory.\nYou will see the folders and files like in this structure:\nsite_root |-- archetypes |-- assets |-- content |-- data |-- layouts |-- static |-- themes |-- config.toml The detail explaination for each folder is published on Hugo documentation, and it is necessary to understand it before continue.\nInstall theme Next, we wll pick a theme at Hugo theme website and install in themes folder. I will choose Hugo Stack Theme for the demonstration.\nCopy the theme\u0026rsquo;s github path, and install:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack themes/hugo-theme-stack Go to the installed theme directory, you will see the exampleSite folder. Copy its content and paste into content folder. It stores all page and post we create for the website, so we will use it to test the new site.\nReplace config.toml by config.yaml copied above, and modify this file as in this intruction.\nPublish to Github Page After you add a post or a site, it\u0026rsquo;s time to push into the repository and publish. But first, we have to link the Github page repository to the current development repository:\ngit submodule add -b master https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git public It will clone the repository into public folder, as in Hugo documentation about directory structure. Check again with git remote -v:\norigin\thttps://github.com/username/username.github.io.git (fetch) origin\thttps://github.com/username/username.github.io.git (push) Then publish the site by running ./deploy.sh:\n#!/bin/sh # If a command fails then the deploy stops set -e printf \u0026quot;\\033[0;32mDeploying updates to GitHub...\\033[0m\\n\u0026quot; # Create commit message msg=\u0026quot;rebuilding site $(date)\u0026quot; if [ -n \u0026quot;$*\u0026quot; ]; then msg=\u0026quot;$*\u0026quot; fi # Build the project. echo \u0026quot;\u0026quot; echo \u0026quot;\u0026quot; echo \u0026quot;Committing changes to $(pwd)\u0026quot; hugo -D # Go To Public folder cd public # Add 'public' (Github Pages repo) changes to git and commit/push. echo \u0026quot;\u0026quot; echo \u0026quot;\u0026quot; echo \u0026quot;Committing changes to $(pwd)\u0026quot; git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;$msg\u0026quot; git push origin master # Add this repos changes to git and commit/push. First 'cd' out of public cd .. echo \u0026quot;\u0026quot; echo \u0026quot;\u0026quot; echo \u0026quot;Committing changes to $(pwd)\u0026quot; git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;$msg\u0026quot; git push origin master Modification You can also modify the theme to suit your need.
