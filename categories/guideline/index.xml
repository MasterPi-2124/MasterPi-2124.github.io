      <description>If you used Mac products before, I bet the only thing you will never forget is its multi-touch trackpad. Its convenience can improve the work performance a lot, and it even made me feel confused when using other products&amp;rsquo;s trackpad. Luckily, when you say &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo;, you are talking about the &amp;ldquo;Open Sources&amp;rdquo;, and there are some drivers that support it, like mtrack.
In this blog, we will dive into how we can make our trackpad as close to Mac experience as we can get with mtrack.</description>
